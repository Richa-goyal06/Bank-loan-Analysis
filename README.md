# Bank loan Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
### The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Dashboard 1: Summary
### Banks and financial institutions handle thousands of loan applications every month. However, without a structured analytics system, it becomes challenging to monitor lending performance, track repayments, and evaluate borrower health.
### This project addresses that challenge by building a Power BI dashboard that tracks key KPIs like total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and DTI ratios. It also includes a loan status grid view to differentiate good and bad loans, enabling faster, data-driven decisions in lending operations.
